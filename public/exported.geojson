        "description": " The Bully is a Warrior who loses touch with his vulnerability and his sensitivity. He has the false belief that Courage means not being afraid, so he pretends not to be afraid and tries to control his feelings. Instead of using his strength and agressiveness to serve the realm, he uses them to only serve his own interests. His anger becomes violent, and his actions cause unnecessary pain and suffering in others.   \n  \n  \n## Shadow Declarations  \n- I am not afraid of anything. Nothing can hurt me.  \n- I don't care about feelings  \n- I hate weak people  \n  \n## Balancing the Bully  \n- If I'm attracting Victims in my life then the Bully energy is out of balance and taking over.   \n- I get in touch with the vulnerability and sensitivity of the Victim  \n- I remember that I need love and connection to other people, and that my feelings and theirs matter.   \n- I remember that courage doesn't mean not being afraid. I connect with my fear and accept it.  \n- I remember that strength doesn't mean not having weakness. I connect with my weakness and accept it.  \n- I remember that I'm here to serve something greater than myself, and that my strength was given to me to serve others.  \n- I focus on using force only for protection  \n- I let go of the idea that other people are my enemy.  \n- I stop trying to control my feelings and the feelings of others.  \n  \n## Gift of the Bully  \nIf a Warrior is stuck in Victim energy, they need the gift of the bully's explosive anger in order to get back in touch with their strength.   \n  \n**Off Balance:** Tries to override vulnerability with Strength  \n**Qualities:** Unhealthy Anger, Forcing, Coersion, Cruelty, Violence",

He uses the hatred to connect to his power and serve the realm. He understands that good and evil are inside of him. And not something that’s out there to be eliminated.   \n  \nHe does this by feeling his hatred fully, and letting its energy fill his heart and his body, but never discharging it. By accepting the hatred in his body, not denying it, and not acting it out, he let's his body transform hatred into pure power.   \n  \nThe Tyrant, feels the hatred, but cannot hold it in his body so he turns it outwards and discharges it. The Weakling, denies the hatred, and tries not to feel it. He represses it, and doesn't let it into his body. This way, he cuts himself off from his power.   \n  \nWhen the Tyrant discharges his power, he turns it outwards towards others in violence. The power then leaves his body and hurts others, leaving him weak and unbalanced. This Tyrant energy disturbs the peace and starts war.   \n  \nWhen the Weakling avoids owning his power he acts \"nice\" and pretends to like things he doesn't, and accepts things that don't work. He does this because he is afraid to lose the relationships in his life, and doesn't want to scare people with his power. Weakling energy creates a \"fake\" peace because the weakling is battling inside himself with hatred.  \n  \nWhen the King lets his power fill his body, mind, and heart, he is peaceful and centered. Pure power doesn't hurt anyone. It does not attack or violate others, and does not allow others to attack or violate. Mature King power creates true peace.  \n",

The less responsibility he takes, the weaker he gets, which leads to taking less responsibility. This makes the weakling always depend on other people to take care of his realm. He becomes less free, and attracts tyrants into his life who will manipulate and control him.   \n  \nThe Tyrant tries to control others. This makes them weak and keeps him in control. He does things for others that they can do for themselves. He loses his freedom this way because he attracts weaklings into his life that demand that he takes care of them. Because he is always trying to control everything, the Tyrant can never relax or rest, and is never free.  \n  \nThe Mature King understands that the more he is responsible for others, the free-er he his. He takes as much responsibility as he can, and expects others to be responsible for themselves. He learns from the wolf. He leads his pack but expects them to be responsible. This allows him to play with them as equals. He doesn't control them, and doesn't leave them. As part of a pack, he makes sure he is contributing and carrying his own weight. If he needs help he asks for it, until he can get back on his feet. If he's asked for help, he gives it only to the point where the other wolf can take care of himself. If a wolf does not take care of his responsibilities, eventually the pack leaves him, and he learns the hard way to take care of himself.   \n  \n  \n## Mature Responsibility Principles  \n- Define clear boundaries for your realm  \n- Take full responsibility for everything inside your realm, and don't take responsibility for anything outside it  \n- Take full responsibility for your feelings, actions, and needs  \n- Don't take responsibility for other people's feelings, actions, or needs  \n- Only help when someone asks for help and don't push your help on anyone  \n- Don't let anyone do something for you that you can do for yourself  \n- Don't do something for someone that they can do for themselves  \n- Expand your realm every day by increasing what you're responsible for  \n- Respect other's freedom to live their lives and make their own choices",

Those emotions are poison to any living goal.”  \n  \n>“When things feel murky and unsure, fine tuning our hearing so as to distinguish the voice of our Innermost Self brings clarity.”   \n  \nA king needs a clear mind to see reality as it is, not how he would like it to be. He learns from the eagle how to soar above the details and look at the big picture. He learns from the air element how to not hold on to ideas, or opinions, and clear the mind to receive the information that's needed. When he is not clear, he learns to be in silence, and to wait for clarity.   \n  \nA Mature King does not confuse his mind for his brain. He makes sure his body and heart are clear, for he knows that the mind is not just in the head. In order to be clear, he must have a grounded belly, a content heart, and an empty mind. Clarity means the belly, the heart, and the mind are all aligned.   \n  \nThe King learns to clear his mind by getting rest, connecting to nature, going for a walk, listening to music, or moving his body. Above all, like the eagle, he learns to connect to the sky, rise above the details, and wait until he sees what he is looking for.   \n  \nThe Tyrant and the Weakling both do not have clarity. The Tyrant does not wait for clarity, and makes decisions and acts blindly. The Weakling doubts himself when clarity comes and doesn't trust his mind, or his seeing. ",

If we run away from the difficult parts, we’ll feel like a coward. If we feel like a coward, we won’t respect ourselves. And we can’t lie to ourselves about what we’re actually doing; on a deep level, we know the truth. So we have to grapple with the difficulties in a courageous way. That’s how we gain respect and value.\"  \n  \n>\"When you are being your true self, you are not looking for pleasure, you are not avoiding pain, you are not trying to get approval, nor trying to get someone to admire you. You are not out to criticize someone else, or to defeat someone else, and you are not out to gain fame or power. You are naturally and spontaneously living as a genuine human being who has respect and consideration for other human beings. ……….. To make these values and manifestations second nature, you have to put conscious effort into them. You have to make it your work. This does not mean that you have to be solemn and grim and serious; that is not the point. The point is to act with sincerity and to put conscious effort into being aware of yourself and others in order to treat yourself and others with respect. This also does not mean giving up pleasure; it means not seeking pleasure. It does not mean creating pain; it means not avoiding pain. Life is to be lived with the integrity, dignity, and self-respect of a person who knows that the point is not whether something feels good or bad. The point is not to lose your self-respect, not to abandon your true reality, the highest and purest elements within you. Regardless of how wonderful things are and regardless of how painful things are, your self-respect is strong enough to maintain your sense of integrity. That integrity does not mean having your way, or winning or succeeding or anything like that. It means being sincere about who you are and acting in ways that reflect your essential human values.\"  \n  \n- Self respect, means having a good reputation with yourself. Keeping your word to yourself. Making decisions and taking actions in a way that makes you like yourself.   \n- When we treat ourselves with respect and set good boundaries, we teach other people how we want to be treated.   \n- Tyrant demands respect.

To honor the sanctity of everything.   \n- Not criticizing self or others. Tyrant criticizes others. Weakling criticizes self and lets others criticize him. King accepts himself and others.   \n- King apologizes with self respect. appropriate remorse and regret. Tyrants lives unapologitecially. Weakling diminishes himself in shame when he apologizes.   \n- Respects his body. Tyrant controls his body. Weakling neglects his body.   \n- Respecting the earth, our environment, our word, our limitations, Respect opposition and enemy. Respect their shadow.   \n- Spend time with respectful and self-respecting people  \n- We gain self respect and self-worth by confronting the challenges in our lives head on and doing our best.   \n- People with Self Respect:   \n Honor their values and morals more often than not.  \n Speak about themselves confidently but with appropriate humility.  \n Dress in a way that reflects the positive way they feel about themselves.  \n Have a personal mission statement or personal operating system to guide them.  \n Admit their flaws and mistakes and work to improve them.  \n Don't allow other people to take advantage of them or speak down to them.  \n Know when to leave a compromising or unhealthy situation or relationship.  \n Treat their bodies and minds with care and honor.  \n Can show respect to others who merit it.  \n Recognize that their time, energy, and resources are valuable.  \n Can create appropriate boundaries with others.  \n Don't need to apologize for who they are.  \n Take personal responsibility for all of their actions.  \n Don't feel diminished by constructive criticism or advice.  \n Keep trying in the face of adversity and don't give up on themselves.  \n  \n  ",

Is disconnected from the countless gifts he did not earn. The Weakling lives in scarcity. Disconnected from the abundance in our world.   \n  \nTo return to generosity:  \n  \n- Connect with gratitude and abundance  \n- Practice giving at the edge of your joy  \n- Notice how your heart longs to give its gift  \n- Prioritize connection with other over things  \n- Trust that you'll be taken care of  \n  \nhttps://charleseisenstein.org/essays/living-in-the-gift/  \nhttp://newstoryhub.com/2016/12/giving-david-whyte/  \nhttps://www.diamondapproach.org/glossary/refinery_phrases/generosity  \n  \n>In the story of Interbeing, life is a gift. The world and everything in it is a gift. We did not earn our lives. We did not earn the sun; it is not thanks to our hard efforts that it shines. We did not earn the ability of plants to grow. We did not earn water. We did not earn our conception nor our breath. Our hearts beat and our livers metabolize all on their own. Life is a gift. ~ Charles Eisenstein  \n  \n>When we apprehend these basic truths, gratitude comes naturally. Gratitude is the knowledge of having received and the consequent desire to give in turn. It is primal. All beings including human beings have an unquenchable desire to pour forth their gifts. That is why if you are in a situation where your gifts are not valued, not received, or not useful, you will want to leave that situation, that job or relationship. No matter how much you are being paid, no matter how scared you are to leave the relationship, you’re going to want to bust out and develop and express your capacity to give to the world in service of something you care about. ~ Charles Eisenstein  \n  \n>Speaking of poverty is another way of talking about surrender, about generosity, nonattachment, selflessness. But the state of poverty has a sense of sacredness. Poverty is so absent of everything that it is absolutely sacred. There are no contaminations, no impurities, nothing exists in it absolutely. It is so empty of everything, all attachments, all objects, all qualities, that it is absolute sacredness. The sense is that poverty is where God comes from, the abode of God. Poverty is the condition before anything comes to being. It is completely absolutely sacred because it has not been contaminated by anything occurring. No creation has happened yet. Nothing has occurred. Nothing has been said. Some people call poverty the great death. It is not just the death of you or your ego. It is the death of everything. The absolute cessation and annihilation of all that can be perceived, felt, experienced. It is pre-existence. ~A.H.Almaas  \n  \n>When there are no boundaries, what naturally arises is love, abundance, and generosity, because what blocks love are the boundaries. There is no sense then that you are going to love someone, or that you want someone to love you. You are just you; you are natural, you are just living a human life, and there is love in it, naturally. You do not say, “I want to do this because I want to be loving.” You just do it naturally. You are loving, without having to think about it. You do not have to feel compassionate to be helpful. You are helpful regardless of whether you feel helpful or not. Compassion might be present; you might not even care about it. You are just helpful. So, in a sense, in the Work, nothing is for you; at the same time, everything is for you because you are everything. Each one of us can come to see that these are not ideas, that this is not a point of view. This is actually the fact, this is the state of affairs; it is how things are when your mind is not interpreting things. ~A.H.Almaas  \n  \n>Clearly, the most obvious thing is what all the traditions and teachings have said, which is to live selflessly: to give of oneself instead of accumulating for oneself. The more you give, the more generous you are, the more compassionate, the more loving, the more selfless you are, the less there is an identification with the person because the person is an experience of being an island. An island needs to be protected and enhanced, but if you don’t try to protect it or enhance it, then the generosity will tend to eliminate the boundaries. Generosity is a good word because generosity is an openness. There is no holding back in true generosity. I don’t mean simply open and giving physically, but in all ways. It means not protecting yourself. I don’t mean not protecting yourself in the sense of not closing your doors at night. Not protecting yourself means not trying to build psychological boundaries, not trying to thicken your boundaries, but working on dissolving those boundaries. Generosity really is the heart of the oneness or the unity. When there is the experience of oneness, the heart is experienced as absolute generosity. There is absolutely no holding back. Whatever is there—love, compassion, understanding, knowledge, help—just flows out. But there is a tendency to protect yourself because of a lack understanding . It is not because you are bad. In a relative way, you exist, but if you think of who you are ultimately, you are not a person; yet a person is one of your manifestations. ~A.H.Almaas  \n  \n>When you see that your focus on your self, your separateness, your preoccupation with your personal life, are all barriers against the natural order of reality, you become more willing to be open and loving. There is no threat then about being generous. You see that generosity is our nature. There is no loss in letting go of your point of view; there is tremendous gain—yet no self gains it. The gain is everyone’s gain, the gain is for the universe. You will feel freedom, joy, fulfillment and happiness—but these feelings are not for you to possess, they are for the universe. Whenever any human being loses his point of view, the entire human race benefits. Ultimately, the work we do to understand our lives and our selves is not for us individually, but for the good of everyone, for the earth as a whole. ~A.H.Almaas",

He doesn't let one defeat the other.   \n  \nThe Bully uses the truth to get what they want. They only choose the parts of the truth that suit them in order to control others and use force. When the Bully tells the truth, they don't care about people’s heart and just blurt it out. Because they do this without kindness, the truth does not penetrate. It hurts.   \n  \nThe Victim keeps the truth in because they are trying to be kind. They lie to themselves and others. Because they are afraid to hurt people they put down their sword of truth. This means they also can't hear other warriors' feedback because it hurts them.   \n  \nHonesty can be scary. It requires a warriors courage. The hardest kind of honesty, is honesty with yourself.  \n  \nThe Mature Warrior tells the truth and includes the fact that he cares about their (feelings heart- don't understand) as part of the truth. He lets other people's feedback impact him without taking it personally.  \n  \n  \n## Honesty Principles   \n- Never lie.   \n- Say what you mean, mean what you say.   \n- Stop speaking if someone isn’t listening. Your words are too precious to waste.   \n- Confront lies, and untruths in yourself and others.   \n- Don’t say things that make you feel weaker.   \n- Hold your opinions lightly.   \n- Assume there’s always more truth than what you can see.   \n- Go into silence until you know the truth.  \n- Real kindness is being honest **and** open-hearted.  \n  \n----  \n  \n>HONESTY is reached through the doorway of grief and loss. Where we cannot go in our mind, our memory, or our body is where we cannot be straight with another, with the world, or with our self. The fear of loss, in one form or another, is the motivator behind all conscious and unconscious dishonesties: all of us are afraid of loss, in all its forms, all of us, at times, are haunted or overwhelmed by the possibility of a disappearance, and all of us therefore, are one short step away from dishonesty. Every human being dwells intimately close to a door of revelation they are afraid to pass through. Honesty lies in understanding our close and necessary relationship with not wanting to hear the truth. The ability to speak the truth is as much the ability to describe what it is like to stand in trepidation at this door, as it is to actually go through it and become that beautifully honest spiritual warrior, equal to all circumstances, we would like to become. Honesty is not the revealing of some foundational truth that gives us power over life or another or even the self, but a robust incarnation into the unknown unfolding vulnerability of existence, where we acknowledge how powerless we feel, how little we actually know, how afraid we are of not knowing and how astonished we are by the generous measure of loss that is conferred upon even the most average life. Honesty is grounded in humility and indeed in humiliation, and in admitting exactly where we are powerless. Honesty is not found in revealing the truth, but in understanding how deeply afraid of it we are. To become honest is in effect to become fully and robustly incarnated into powerlessness. Honesty allows us to live with not knowing. We do not know the full story, we do not know where we are in the story; we do not know who is at fault or who will carry the blame in the end. Honesty is not a weapon to keep loss and heartbreak at bay, honesty is the outer diagnostic of our ability to come to ground in reality, the hardest attainable ground of all, the place where we actually dwell, the living, breathing frontier where there is no realistic choice between gain or loss. ~ David Whyte  \n  \n----  \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxcfiAo_8S4  \n  \n",

        "description": "#draft   \n  \nQuodoskha book. page 85  \npage 202 dh1 book  \nhttp://www.amberallen.com/uncategorized/the-fourth-agreement-always-do-your-best/  \n  \nalways do your best  \nVictim, makes impeccability an outside standard that he can never live up to.   \nBully, focuses outwards and demands impeccability from others  \nMature warrior is impeccable with himself regardless of how others are  \n  \nindulgence to be and do your best at every moment page   \n  \n>To act impeccably means to act with certainty. You cannot act impeccably when you are not sure of yourself. You know it is the best thing, even if you know that it is not perfect, but you do it with certainty. You’re learning to defend against your superego. You are not completely sure what this means, but you know something, and what you know is the best you know, and you do this as if you are certain. And this is what you do until you learn something else. In time, this will evolve and develop into what we call true certainty – essential certainty. Choosing to be an impeccable warrior means choosing to be a person, choosing to be a responsible adult, instead of being your mother’s baby. There is dignity in it; you are your own person, your life is your responsibility and you always have the choice to do your best. Impeccability can be in action, in feeling, in thinking. Impeccability can be in terms of the will, in terms of the mind, in terms of the heart. ~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n>To be an impeccable warrior, you do your tasks impeccably and your task is to be impeccable. That’s it. You do your best. After a while, you are impeccable for the sake of impeccability itself. I’ve talked about it in terms of a path leading someplace, but it is actually what we’re going toward. It’s both the means and the end. When you are really impeccable, that’s it. It’s not as if you’re looking for truth because truth will lead you someplace, to something else. No. You are dedicated to the truth because the truth is truth. It is the same thing with impeccability.  ~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n>Being Impeccable is to Be and Do Your Best at Every Moment. As you confront your indulgences, you will see that to continue to be really impeccable and not succumb to your indulgences will mean letting go of all kinds of things. The way of impeccability can be taken as a path on its own. You could attempt to be impeccable all the time. All your indulgences would arise, and these would reveal all your attachments. Impeccability means letting go of those attachments. The way of the impeccable warrior is complete in itself. It is a path to a certain knowledge. In our Work here, we’re not taking that path by itself, but we’re using it. We’re taking that attitude as an aid. That aspect, that perspective, that facet, has a certain point of view, a certain way of looking at things that is needed for our Work to be effective. As we have described, being impeccable is to be and do your best at every moment. At those times when you feel you cannot do your best, you can still do your best by impeccably deciding you will take some time off. This applies to everything you do. To live impeccably means to live impeccably in all tasks, in all aims, in all undertakings, whether you’re learning to defend against your superego or learning to be present all the time. Each one of these needs to be done impeccably for it to actually work. It is the perspective of a certain aspect of Essence that is needed for all the other aspects. As we have seen, indulgence will arise along with uncertainty, and your indulgence and uncertainty will try to stop you from being an impeccable warrior.  ~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n>Choosing to be an impeccable warrior means choosing to be a responsible adult instead of being your mother’s baby. There is dignity in it; you are your own person. Your life is your responsibility, and you always have the choice to do your best. Impeccability can be in action, in feeling, in thinking. Impeccability can be in terms of the will, in terms of the mind, in terms of the heart. One of the times when some people will become most uncertain about impeccability is when it comes to the heart—where there is softness and gentleness and delicacy—because impeccability seems to imply something sharp and straight. But you can be impeccable about love. This means that you have some understanding about your attractions and their patterns, what’s positive in them and what’s negative. And in this case, to be impeccable means to act according to the knowledge you have about these things. You might know, for instance, that you always give up your heart for the sake of approval, or pleasure, or security, and you know this always creates a mess. In this case, to act impeccably means to go against the usual inclinations of your heart because your heart is not free, not impeccable on its own. ~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n>Defending Against the Superego Impeccably. When you're learning to defend against your superego, you really need to be an impeccable warrior. You can’t do it in a haphazard way. You can’t do it at one time and not at another, a little bit now, a little bit later. It won’t work. You have to do it constantly, all the time, impeccably. That means if you really want to learn about defending against your superego, you make it your number one aim …you are always aware of defending yourself against your superego and you do your best. ~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n>Impeccability is Concerned with Now. Being impeccable means you’re not thinking of being something in the future. It means you’re doing something right now. You’re sitting. How do you sit impeccably? How do you listen impeccably? How do you ask questions impeccably? Impeccability is concerned with now, with complete presence at every moment. You are either impeccable or you are not. Part of impeccability is taking limitations into consideration because if you don’t, you’re indulging. You take your limitations into consideration as much as you can. Impeccability is not judged by superego. It is judged by reality, what’s really there. If there is something that can be done, you do it. You do your best at every moment.  ~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n> It is not to be perfect but to do your best, to act according to all the wisdom, all the understanding, all the experience, all the awareness, all the will that you have. As you confront your indulgences, you will see that to continue to be really impeccable and not succumb to your indulgences will mean letting go of all kinds of things. The way of impeccability can be taken as a path on its own. You could attempt to be impeccable all the time and all your indulgences would arise, which would reveal all your attachments. Impeccability means letting go of those attachments. The way of the impeccable warrior is a way complete in itself, is a path to a certain knowledge. In our Work here, we’re not taking that path by itself, but we’re using it. We’re taking that attitude as an aid.~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n> To be impeccable is to be realistic. You don’t expect from yourself what you cannot do; you expect the best you can do. Because the way of impeccability will bring up all kinds of uncertainties and unsureness, you will ultimately learn certainty because you will have to deal with those uncertainties. In time, impeccability will become certainty. You become  \ncertain in yourself. You have a certainty that has nothing to do with your mind. So, to act impeccably means to act with certainty. You cannot act impeccably when you are not sure of yourself. You know what the best thing is, and you do it with certainty, even if you know that it is not perfect. You’re learning to defend against your superego. Maybe you are not completely sure what this means, but you know something. And since what you know is thebest you know, you do this as if you are certain. You do this until you learn something else. In time, this attitude will evolve into what we call true certainty, essential certainty.~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n> I was sure that question would come up. That question is probably arising in the minds of most of you because it is very hard to understand what being impeccable is. On the subtle level of learning to be impeccable, what will arise is the issue of uncertainty. You’re not certain; you’re not sure. “Is this the right way, or is that the right way?” “What does it mean to be impeccable now?” “Is this really impeccability, or is it my superego?” “Am I really indulging, or am I being impeccable?” Things get a little tricky. The personality has its powers and its subtleties. But you see, this is exactly what I was saying. You cannot be perfect in it. Doing things perfectly is not the point. The point is doing your best. If you are not certain, you have two ways to go: this way or that way. The impeccable thing is to take the attitude of the impeccable warrior when the warrior is uncertain. To deal with uncertainty impeccably, you do the best you can do in the situation. At the moment of uncertainty, you might need to pay more attention to yourself, to take the attitude of the detached observer instead of deciding to go this way or that way. Uncertainties will arise, especially when it comes to learning how to be, how to act as an impeccable warrior. As I said earlier, uncertainty is the enemy of impeccability. It is the most subtle enemy. Uncertainty is due to incomplete awareness, incomplete knowledge of what is there. This will often arise because you rarely know everything about a situation. That is exactly when the attitude of impeccability is needed. It is not to be perfect, but to do your best to act according to all the wisdom, all the understanding, all the experience, all the awareness, all the will that you have.~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n> So what do we do about our indulgences, about our tendencies and attitudes and actions that we know are not good for us and that keep us trapped in our personality? Learning how to deal with indulgence means you must have a certain perspective, a certain attitude toward your life and work. It has to do with how you take action, what you do at any given moment. This brings us to a method that deals primarily with indulgence: the path of the warrior. When you are working on yourself, you need the attitude of the warrior. Not the worrier, the warrior. You need to live the life of the impeccable warrior. To really do the Work, to really be able to succeed, you need to live and work like an impeccable warrior. Everything needs to be done with impeccability. Every attitude, every task, every aim needs to be done impeccably. Now what does that mean? To do something impeccably doesn’t mean to do it perfectly. Let’s look at some examples of what it does mean. Suppose you know you need to work on a certain tendency; for example, you want to stop trying to please other people all the time. Perhaps you take an aim not to try to please other people. How can you do that impeccably? It means you do the best you can in terms of that aim, always, at all times.~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n> Student: I get confused about knowing when my superego is beating me up and when I know I need to be impeccable. It’s hard to tell the difference.  \nAlmaas: I was sure that question would come up. That question is probably arising in the minds of most of you because it is very hard to understand what being impeccable is. On the subtle level of learning to be impeccable, what will arise is the issue of uncertainty. You’re not certain; you’re not sure. “Is this the right way, or is that the right way?” “What does it mean to be impeccable now?” “Is this really impeccability, or is it my superego?” “Am I really indulging, or am I being impeccable?” Things get a little tricky. The personality has its powers and its subtleties. But you see, this is exactly what I was saying. You cannot be perfect in it. Doing things perfectly is not the point. The point is doing your best. If you are not certain, you have two ways to go: this way or that way. The impeccable thing is to take the attitude of the impeccable warrior when the warrior is uncertain. To deal with uncertainty impeccably, you do the best you can do in the situation. At the moment of uncertainty, you might need to pay more attention to yourself, to take the attitude of the detached observer instead of deciding to go this way or that way. Uncertainties will arise, especially when it comes to learning how to be, how to act as an impeccable warrior. As I said earlier, uncertainty is the enemy of impeccability. It is the most subtle enemy. Uncertainty is due to  \nincomplete awareness, incomplete knowledge of what is there. This will often arise because you rarely know everything about a situation. That is exactly when the attitude of impeccability is needed. It is not to be perfect, but to do your best to act according to all the wisdom, all the understanding, all the experience, all the awareness, all the will that you have.~ A.H. Almaas  \n  \n> To be impeccable at that moment is to do all that you can do to pay attention, to use whatever you have learned, especially at those times when you know you have a tendency not to pay attention. Your knowledge is not perfect, not complete, but you use what you know, the best techniques you have, the best attitude you have, the best understanding you have, and apply it right then. ~ A.H.

He knows that his value and self-worth comes from how he meets winning or losing, not whether or not he wins or loses. He is graceful in winning, and dignified in losing.   \n  \nVictims and Bullies think that the only thing that matters is winning. They incorrectly think that their value and self-worth comes from winning and avoiding losing.   \n  \nThe Bully does not acknowledge defeat. He gloats when winning, and gets enraged when losing.  To maintain a false sense of dignity, he forgets his defeats quickly and tries to move on. Never learning to be humble.  \n  \nThe Victim loses his dignity when defeated. He mopes when losing, and pretends to have false humility when winning. Because he's afraid of losing, he doesn't have the courage to try things that are challenging, and gets weaker with time.   \n  \nBecause the victim is humiliated by limitation and failure, he attracts bullies that humiliate him. Because the Bully refuses humility, they humiliate others.   \n  \nThe Mature Warrior lets his limitation bring humility. He defends against bullying voices and keeps his dignity. He knows his worth and meets his limitations.  \nHe becomes like water. Staying close to the earth and respecting his limits. Like water, he uses patience and persistence to carve through rock.  \n  \nWhen the Bully and Victim fall to their knees, they are humiliated and hang their head down in shame. Their shame comes from not having tried their best before being defeated. When the Warrior falls to his knees, he is humbled. Because he has tried his best, he is not humiliated. He connects to the source to reflect, heal and learn. He finds balance again, and gets back on the battlefield.    \n  \nThe victim bends his head in self-pity.

The opposite isn't uncertainty. It's openness, curiosity and a willingness to embrace paradox, rather than choose up sides. The ultimate challenge is to accept ourselves exactly as we are, but never stop trying to learn and grow.”   \n  \nCuriosity is what drives the Magician to learn about the mystery, and to transform the world. The mature Magician wonders about everything, and wants to know how things work, what things are, and most importantly, wants to understand himself and connect to the spirit.   \n  \nThe Manipulator is focused on having answers, because he is afraid of the mystery and wants to be in control. The Dummy feels humiliated and embarrassed by not knowing and so hides his curiosity, and pretends to know. The mature Magician enjoys the question, and loves asking it. The moment he gets an answer he finds the next question for the fun of it.   \n  \nWhen exploring with other people, the mature Magician always assumes other people know something that he doesn't. He tries to learn from them. The Manipulator thinks that he knows it all. He doesn't listen or ask questions, and just wants to show off what he knows. The Dummy doesn't want to reveal there's something he doesn't know, and doesn't share his knowledge because he feels insecure.  \n---  \n  \nBeginner's mind  \n",

The world of spirit, and the world of matter.   \n  \nHe knows that he is not of the world. He is not his body. He is not his mind or heart. He is a spirit/soul that is connected to a mystery outside of time and space. A Mature, and also knows that his spirit has chosen to come into the material world. To inhabit a body in time and space.   \n  \nIn order to become a bridge between the world, the Magician respects both equally, and makes it his business to bring the mystery to life. To fully inhabit mater and honor it's sacred nature. He connects the \"as above\" to the \"so below\". To do this, the magician studies the way his body and his soul are connected. He creates sacred spaces in the physical world and tends them. Alters. Temples. He collects and respects sacred objects and symbols. He spends time in nature. He learns the way of the artist, bringing spirit into form through dance, music, poetry, painting, sculpting, and prayer. He learns to make his body, heart and mind and instrument for spirit to play.   \n  \nThis is the Mature Magician as Priest. It is the vertical connection. Connecting Father Sky to Mother Earth.   \n  \nThe Manipulator, is disconnected from spirit, and is lost in the world of the material. Because he is disconnected, matter is no longer sacred. He uses his knowledge to manipulate matter, instead of infusing it with spirit.   \nManipulator becomes materialist by disconnecting from above.  \n  \nThe Dummy can become a space cadet by disconnecting from below. He is more concerned with the spirit world and doesn't respect the world of matter. He abdicates the tonal world and does a spiritual bypass. For the Dummy, the material world doesn't matter. And so again, he does not create sacred space.   \n  \nhttps://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/world-not-it  \n",

        "description": " The Mature Magician is the knower and the master of technology. He guides the process of transformation, both within and without, by using ritual and ceremony. He is initiated into secret and hidden knowledge of all kinds by other Magicians. All knowledge that takes special training to acquire is the province of the Magician. He has insight, and connects the hidden world and the visible world with his knowledge. He uses this knowledge for the benefit of the realm.  \n  \n  \n## Mature Declarations  \n- I use my brilliance, creativity, knowledge, and skills to guide others and serve something greater than myself.   \n- I don't know everything, but I can figure it out.   \n- My purpose is to master transformation and to bridge the manifest and unmanifest worlds.  \n- I am thoughtful, reflective, and emotionally detached.  \n- I feed my spirit by connecting to nature and to the divine. I use this connection to heal others and help them get back into connection.   \n- I love building, creating, making music, art, and making something out of nothing.   \n- I compare myself to my past self, and I'm always improving my skills. Every mistake makes me more competent.   \n- I love learning and teaching.

        "description": " The Manipulator is a Magician who has lost touch with his higher purpose. Instead of guiding others to open their eyes, he controls them in ways they cannot see. Instead of initiating others and lifting them up, he uses his knowledge to keep them down and demonstrate his superiority. He withholds knowledge, and uses secrets to exploit others.   \n  \n  \n## Shadow Declarations  \n- I use my skills and knowledge to control people and to serve myself.   \n- I don't need to figure things out, because I already know.  \n- I am better than others because I know more.    \n- I compare myself to others and find ways that I'm better than them.  \n- I don't aknowledge my failures.  \n- I'm disconnected from the mystery.  \n  \n## Balancing the Manipulator  \n- I get in touch with the wonder and \"beginner's mind\" of the Dummy to feel less arrogant, and more curious.   \n- I remember that my knowledge was given to me by others, and that I have a duty to use it to benefit others, and to pass it on to others.  \n- I begin comparing myself to my past self instead of to others.  \n- I stop pretending to know everything and cultivate a beginner's mind.  \n- I spend time in nature and connect with the spirit. This reminds me of the great mystery and my place in it.   \n- I remember that there is so much I don't know and there is so much to learn.   \n  \n  \n## Gift of the Manipulator  \nWhen the Magician is in his Dummy shadow, he needs the gift of my confidence to get in touch with his ability to know, learn and grow, and not be lost in the mystery.   \n  \n**Off Balance:** Believes his knowledge is bigger than the mystery, so becomes arrogant and tries to control the mystery.   \n**Qualities:** Grandiosity. Arrogance. Manipulative. Hustler.  \n  \n----  \n  \nTrickster",

I let them guide me to learn.  \n- I remember that confidence doesn't come from knowing everything, it comes from learning to figure things out.   \n- I learn to meditate so I can detach and connect to the mystery.   \n  \n  \n## Gift of the Dummy  \nWhen the Magician is in the Manipulator shadow, he needs the gift of \"beginner's mind.\" This helps him be in touch with mystery and humility.  \n  \n**Off Balance:** Believes that the mystery is too much and loses touch with his capacity to know.  \n**Qualities:** Ignorance. False Humility. Lack of curiosity. Fear of failure.",
